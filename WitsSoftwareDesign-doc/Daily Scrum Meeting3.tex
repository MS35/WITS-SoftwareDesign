\subsection{Major Tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item PIMD Venue Booking View
\item Create School Provisional Venue Allocation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Major Issues}
One of the major issues we have came across was that we were using the Lamp server for the project and the Mathematical Science Lab management closed the server since we were not really authorized to use it. This caused a bit of a set back to our plan because we had to prepare our venue server which was given to use by Shan in order for use to continue working.

\subsection{Finished Sprint}
Sprint 1 has been closed and all user stories with their respective tasks. Sprint 2 is close to being closed, only a few tests need to be completed and validated.

\subsection{Tasks On Process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Delete Venue Bookings
\item Academic/Administrator Staff Venue Booking Update
\item View Venue Allocations
\end{enumerate}
