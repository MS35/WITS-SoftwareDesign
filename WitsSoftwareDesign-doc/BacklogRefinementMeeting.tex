\subsection{Backlog Refinement}
From our last meeting with the clients there's been a few changes in the backlog,some backlog items were too big so we had to cut them down to smaller user stories. Some of the backlog items moved to the lower bottom of the backlog since after a few discussion we released that they are not really that important.\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item User access
	\item Create venue application
	\item Provisional allocation
	\item View/Read venue application
	\item Solve clashes manually
	\item Import actual class size at the beginning of the next academic year
	\item PIMD view venue application status
	\item Final round of allocation
	\item Update venue application
	\item Delete venue application
	\item Venue allocation list
	\item Venue application deadline
	\item Do late venue application
	\item Allocate unoccupied venues to late venue applications
	\item Notify clashes
	\item Application deadline email reminder
	\item Venue allocation details email notification
	\item Generate student timetable
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Backlog item ranking}
The ranking of each of the backlog item was done in Taiga. Each group member gave a rank between 0 and 40 for the backlog item and we decided on the final rank score but clearly explaining what needs to be done and how it can be done and then chose the suitable time scale.(Please check Taiga for reference)
