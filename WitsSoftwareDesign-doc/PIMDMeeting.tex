\subsection{Collecting the missing data}
The missing data that we are looking for is to know the actual size capacity of each venue, the equipment in the venue, list of venues for each campus. List of all the information on Github and on project group file on Google Drive.

\subsection{Main problems with the current system}
Wits being a larger institution it is very hard to allocate venues to all the courses and make sure that all the requirements are met.\\
\begin{enumerate}[nosep, label=\textendash]
	\item The class system works with diagonals so courses are allocated to diagonals which makes gives them a selection on specific days of the weeks and times to work with. During student registration each course has a maximum student mark as to how many students they are take in one slot for that course, the common mark is usually 350 students per course slot.\\
	Most problems start when the faculty/school starts to accept more that 350 students for that course and want to put them in one class. It it often suggested to them that if they decide to take more than 350 students they should move the extra students to another diagonal which they don't. This results in the situation whereby the course cannot be allocated a venue because there is no venue big enough to accommodate say 500 students.\\
	\item There is now a shortage of venue since Wits now take small venue and make the offices. This is a major problem because the venues that are being removed from the system to be offices are supposed to be used for small group student course but now we would have to move them to bigger venues which those venues can be used for other bigger class course, this results in some courses not having venues or being allocated a smaller venue.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements that PIMD want from the system we are trying to generate}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep, label=\textendash]
	\item Make sure the faculty/school does not register more that 350 students for one course, if they do automatically split the students into 2 or more groups or put the other groups in another diagonal.\\
	\item Reserve the smaller venues to be used for smaller groups classes and not turn the venues into offices.\\
	\item Possibly cancel very small class size course or let the school use seminar rooms in their department building.
\end{enumerate}
